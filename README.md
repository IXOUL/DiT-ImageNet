conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate My_DiT



# Project

Implement a DiT-S model in JAX, and train it on ImageNet.

## Guide 

### Compute Resources
We will primarily use the Adroit cluster for this project.
1. Request an account: complete the [Adroit registration form](https://forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit).
2. Read the scheduler docs: review the [SLURM guide](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm#gpus) to understand GPU job submission.
3. We recommend using MIG A100 or V100 on Adroit for development and debugging.

### JAX
You should use [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax). This community [learning guide](https://github.com/rcrowe-google/Learning-JAX) may be helpful.

### Dataset
Use the [ImageNet-100 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100) (a subset of ImageNet-1k with 100 randomly selected classes).

### DiT
* You should understand the background knowledge, including [Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and [Diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).
* You should understand DiT models [Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748).
* You should understand FID, the evaluation metric.

## Goal
* Tune training hyperparameters and other training settings for DiT-S to obtain an FID-10K score lower than 20 at resolution 256×256. Below are some example images generated from a DiT-S model with FID=19.8.

* More advanced: tweak the architectures to optimize FID, but stay within 33M parameters (the size of DiT-S).

## Instructions
* Invite the GitHub account @r01566525 to your working GitHub repo.
* Work independently.
* Feel free to refer to other resources or tutorials.
* Implement the codebase yourself as much as possible, including the attention module and the training loop; you may use AI or refer to others' code in an assisting capacity only, and you should be able to explain all the code.


## Weekly Reports
* Submit a weekly report (within 3 pages each week, keep in the same Google Doc) at the end of each week.
* Feel free to structure it yourself: you can include progress, issues / solutions, results, plots, or any other relevant things. Feel free to report negative results too, i.e., what has been tried but didn't work.
* Please clearly indicate in which parts of the code you used others' code (link source) or AI, and in what capacity.


## Contact
Please send your weekly reports and requests for help (if any) to r01566525@gmail.com. An initial meeting with a graduate student can be scheduled by emailing this address; further meetings can be arranged if necessary.
